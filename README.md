# Elderly App

This project was created by Gonen Davidi, Dolev Drori, Noya Karavani and Yair Chertkow, 4th year students of Software and Information Systems Engineering in Ben Gurion University. It builds upon a former project by Nadav Chapnick And Ziv Gura named Tele-Vol.
Our aim is to enable researchers from Ben Gurion university of the Negev a platform to conduct their expirements. Our clients are researchers from the university interested in understanding the correlation between loneliness and health of elderly people. We expand upon the exsiting Tele-Vol infrastructure to allow remote online video calls between the elders and volunteers. This in turn gives us the oppurunity to research the influence of the communication of the elders and the volunteer on the health of the elders.
